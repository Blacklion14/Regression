# Decesion Tree Regression

## Definition

A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is one way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements.

It is used whenever we need to fulfil following goals :

  - They’re commonly used by data analysts to carry out predictive analysis.
  - They’re also a popular tool for machine learning and artificial intelligence, where they’re used as training algorithms for supervised learning.

Decision trees can be used to deal with complex datasets, and can be pruned if necessary to avoid overfitting.

## Our Use Case

Here we are using a dataset containing detail about salary demanded by people according to their work experience in years.
We try to find the relations between these variables by performing Simple linear regression to predict whether a new employee with some years of experience is asking
for genuine salary or not.

## Test Our Model

You can test our model by going to our Google Collab session and upload attached dataset in that session and run all cells to visualize the results.

## Results 

On running the Model you will see simillar results as shown below with our given dataset. If you wish to upload your own dataset you can rename and restructure that dataset as ours and upload it to session to view results.
