# Simple Linear Regression

## Definition

Simple linear regression is a Machine learning technique which is used to find out the relation between one dependant variable and one independant variable. 
It is used whenever we need to fulfil following goals :

  - How strong the relationship is between two variables.
  - The value of the dependent variable at a certain value of the independent variable. 

It is the most basic and strict model of regression technique.

## Our Use Case

Here we are using a dataset containing detail about salary demanded by people according to their work experience in years.
We try to find the relations between these variables by performing Simple linear regression to predict whether a new employee with some years of experience is asking
for genuine salary or not.

## Test Our Model

You can test our model by going to our Google Collab session and upload attached dataset in that session and run all cells to visualize the results.

## Results 

On running the Model you will see simillar results as shown below with our given dataset. If you wish to upload your own dataset you can rename and restructure that dataset as ours and upload it to session to view results.
