# Multiple Linear Regression

## Definition

Multiple linear regression is a Machine learning technique which is used to find out the relation between one dependant variable and Multiple independant variable. 
It is used whenever we need to fulfil following goals :

  - How strong the relationship is between two or more independent variables and one dependent variable.
  - The value of the dependent variable at a certain value of the independent variables. 

It is extension of simple linear regression technique.

## Our Use Case

Here we are using a dataset containing detail about companies and their expense areas and their profit.
We try to find the relations between these variables by performing Multiple linear regression to predict which type of company is more suitable for investing purposes.

## Test Our Model

You can test our model by going to our Google Collab session and upload attached dataset in that session and run all cells to visualize the results.

## Results 

On running the Model you will see simillar results as shown below with our given dataset. If you wish to upload your own dataset you can rename and restructure that dataset as ours and upload it to session to view results.

### Test Result

Result below shows a 2D array having predicted results and actual results on test data respectively in each row of result.
