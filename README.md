# Regression Model

## Definition

Regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the 'outcome' or 'response' variable) and one or more independent variables (often called 'predictors', 'covariates', 'explanatory variables' or 'features').
The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which one finds the line (or a more complex linear combination) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion. For example, the method of ordinary least squares computes the unique line (or hyperplane) that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the true data and that line (or hyperplane). 
For specific mathematical reasons (see linear regression), this allows the researcher to estimate the conditional expectation (or population average value) of the dependent variable when the independent variables take on a given set of values. Less common forms of regression use slightly different procedures to estimate alternative location parameters (e.g., quantile regression or Necessary Condition Analysis[1]) or estimate the conditional expectation across a broader collection of non-linear models (e.g., nonparametric regression).

Regression analysis is primarily used for two conceptually distinct purposes.

First, regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting, where its use has substantial overlap with the field of machine learning.

Second, in some situations regression analysis can be used to infer causal relationships between the independent and dependent variables. Importantly, regressions by themselves only reveal relationships between a dependent variable and a collection of independent variables in a fixed dataset. To use regressions for prediction or to infer causal relationships, respectively, a researcher must carefully justify why existing relationships have predictive power for a new context or why a relationship between two variables has a causal interpretation. The latter is especially important when researchers hope to estimate causal relationships using observational data.

## Our Work

Here in this repository I have implemented many Regression techniques for different use cases and real life computation scenarios.
Foloowing are the different implementations:

 - [Single Linear Regression](/Section%201%20-%20Simple%20Linear%20Regression/)
 - [Multiple Linear Regression](/Section%202%20-%20Multiple%20Linear%20Regression/)
 - [Polynomial Regression](/Section%203%20-%20Polynomial%20Regression/)
 - [Decision Tree Regression](/Section%204%20-%20Decision%20Tree%20Regression/)
 - [Random Forest Regression](/Section%205%20-%20Random%20Forest%20Regression/)
