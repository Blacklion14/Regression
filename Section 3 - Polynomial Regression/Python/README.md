# Polynomial Regression

## Definition

Polynomial regression is a Machine learning technique in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x.
Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y.

It is used whenever we need to fulfil following goals :

  - It is used in many experimental procedures to produce the outcome using this equation.
  - It provides a great defined relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

Polynomial Regression is a form of Linear regression known as a special case of Multiple linear regression which estimates the relationship as an nth degree polynomial.

## Our Use Case

Here we are using a dataset containing detail about salary demanded by people according to their work experience in years.
We try to find the relations between these variables by performing Simple linear regression to predict whether a new employee with some years of experience is asking
for genuine salary or not.

## Test Our Model

You can test our model by going to our Google Collab session and upload attached dataset in that session and run all cells to visualize the results.

## Results 

On running the Model you will see simillar results as shown below with our given dataset. If you wish to upload your own dataset you can rename and restructure that dataset as ours and upload it to session to view results.
